# Tigris Provider

The Tigris provider is used to interact with buckets. This provider 
supports creating, reading, updating, deleting, and importing Tigris 
buckets with additional customization options like specifying access keys.

The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials
before it can be used.

## Getting Started

Follow the [getting started guide](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/get-started/)
to setup your Tigris account. You will need to create an access key to use the
Tigris provider.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configure the Tigris provider using the required_providers stanza
# required with Terraform 0.13 and beyond. You may optionally use version
# directive to prevent breaking changes occurring unannounced.
terraform {
  required_providers {
    tigris = {
      source  = "tigrisdata/tigris"
    }
  }
}

provider "tigris" {
  access_key = "your-access-key"
  secret_key = "your-secret-key"
}

# Create a bucket
resource "tigris_bucket" "example_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-custom-bucket"
}

# Create bucket public access rule
resource "tigris_bucket_public_access" "example_bucket_public_access" {
  bucket              = tigris_bucket.example_bucket.bucket
  acl                 = "private"
  public_list_objects = false
}
```
